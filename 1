new lines in new branch 
The wind whispered secrets through the ancient trees, While moonlight danced upon the silent seas. A cat stretched lazily upon a windowsill, Dreaming of adventures, daring and thrill.

Books lay open, pages fluttering free, Echoing stories of what once came to be. Somewhere, laughter drifted down the lane, Carried by echoes of joy and refrain.

And as the stars blinked in the midnight glow, The world kept spinning, steady and slow.
